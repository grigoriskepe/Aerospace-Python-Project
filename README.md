# Aerospace Python Projects

This repository contains small Python projects as part of my learning in **aerodynamics and CFD**.

## Projects
1. Air Density Calculator
- **File:** `air_density.py`
- **Description:** Calculates air density (kg/m³) at given altitudes using a simplified International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) model.  
- **Usage:** Includes example altitudes and prints air density when the script is run directly.

2. Airfoil Plotter
- **File:** `airfoil_plotter.py`
- **Description:** Generates and plots the coordinates of a NACA 4-digit airfoil.
- **Usage:** Helps visualize airfoil shapes commonly used in aerodynamics.
